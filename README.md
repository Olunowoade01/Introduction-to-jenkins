introduction to Jenkins

## Project Topic:

- In this project, I will design and implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment of a web application, ensuring that the application is always up-to-date and running smoothly.


## Step-by-Step Process with Image Explanations

### Step 1: Install Homebrew  
![1](./img/1%20install%20homebrew.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. This image shows the installation process, which is essential for easily installing Jenkins and other tools.

### Step 2: Install Jenkins  
![2](./img/2%20install%20jenkins.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Jenkins is installed using Homebrew. This step ensures Jenkins is downloaded and set up on your Mac.

### Step 3: Access Jenkins via Browser

**Explanation:**  
After installation, Jenkins runs as a service. You can access the Jenkins dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Step 4: Jenkins Unlock Screen

**Explanation:**  
When you first access Jenkins, you are prompted for an initial admin password. This security step ensures only authorized users can complete the setup.

### Step 5: Jenkins Setup Complete

**Explanation:**  
This confirms Jenkins is set up and ready for use. You can now create jobs and configure pipelines.



## Jenkins Freestyle Project Process

### Create a New Jenkins Item  
![1](./img/01%20jenkis%20new%20item.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Start by creating a new Jenkins job (item). This is the entry point for automating builds.

### Configure Your First Job  
![2](./img/02%20my%20first%20job.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Set up the job details, such as the project name and type (Freestyle project).

### Add Git Repository  
![3](./img/03.%20adding%20git%20repo.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Connect your Jenkins job to a source code repository (e.g., GitHub) so Jenkins can pull the latest code.

### Build Now  
![4](./img/04%20build%20now.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Trigger a manual build to test your job configuration and ensure Jenkins can fetch and build your code.

### Configure Build Triggers  
![5](./img/05%20trigger.png)  
**Explanation:**  
Set up automated triggers (like polling the repository or webhook) so Jenkins builds automatically when changes are pushed.

### View Build Status  

![6](./img/06%20status%20showing%20.png)  

**Explanation:**  
Check the status of your builds. Jenkins provides visual feedback on build success or failure.

### Add Webhook for Automation  
![6](./img/06%20webhook%20use%20.png)  

**Explanation:**  
Integrate webhooks from your version control system to trigger Jenkins jobs automatically on code changes.

### Webhook Added Confirmation

**Explanation:**  
This image confirms that the webhook has been successfully added, enabling automated CI/CD workflows.
