introduction to Jenkins

## Project Topic:

- In this project, i will design and implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment of a web application, ensuring that the application is always up-to-date and running smoothly.


## Step 1: Install Homebrew
This shows the installation of Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. Homebrew makes it easy to install and manage software like Jenkins from the terminal.

## Step 2: Install Jenkins
Jenkins is being installed using the Homebrew command. This step downloads and sets up Jenkins on your system, preparing it for use.

## step 3: Access Jenkins via Browser  
After installation, Jenkins runs as a service. You can access the Jenkins dashboard by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Step 4: Jenkins Unlock Screen 
 Access Jenkins, i am prompted to enter an initial admin password. This screen ensures that only authorized users can complete the setup.

## Step 5: Jenkins Setup Complete
The final image confirms that Jenkins has been successfully set up and is ready for use. i can now start creating jobs and configuring my CI/CD pipelines.

Project Goals:

By the end of this project, learners should have:

I understand the concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Familiarized themselves with Jenkins, a widely used CI/CD tool for automating software development processes.
I completed the installation and setup of Jenkins on their local machine or instance.
I configured Jenkins to run on a web console and created a user account.
Set up a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying applications.


## Summary

This project walks through the essential steps to get Jenkins running on a Mac, from installing prerequisites to accessing the Jenkins dashboard. Each image provides a visual reference for the process, making it easier to follow and troubleshoot if needed.
